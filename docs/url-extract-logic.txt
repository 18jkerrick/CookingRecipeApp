This document breaks down the logic that our application should follow 
once it determines what the base url/platform is. 

FOR ALL PLATFORMS, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE INVALID URLS. Ex: fsdgfg (does not have .com, .org, .co, etc.)

Base URL/platform's that we support:

1. Tiktok -> baseurl = tiktok.com
    - There are two types of formats that tiktok users can post
        1. a normal video. Ex url: https://www.tiktok.com/@subwaytakes/video/7603026907248020766
        2. a photo slideshow. Ex url (this is not a recipe fyi, just to show ex url): https://www.tiktok.com/@saradeani/photo/7274254101884538145?_r=1&_t=ZT-93gF9KWQ4Io
    
    Steps: 
    1. For video 
        - Try to get title, ingredients and instructions from the text.
        - These are not mutually exclusive, you may be able to get the title from the text on the post,
        but not the ingredients or instructions. 
        - If any of these 3 (title, ingredients and instructions) are missing, move on to the next extraction
        step
        - The next extraction step is audio. Sometimes there will be a transcript, but othertimes 
        we will have to use a transciber tool or api to take the audio and put it into text. 
        - Move on to the next extraction step if you still do not have all 3 fields (title, ingredients and instructions)
        - The final method is visual. We will take photos periodically of the video. Then we analyze with computer vision.
        This is currently implemented with some type of computer vision. 
        - if we still do not have all three, return a placeholder to the user in the newly created recipe created

    2. For slideshows
        - We try the same steps as before except, we will never try to get audio. 
        - We will also not need to take screenshots periodically for the visual step. This 
        is because we will just download the photos from the photo slideshow and analyze those.  

2. Instagram -> baseurl = instagram.com
     - There are two types of formats that tiktok users can post
        1. Posts. Ex url: https://www.instagram.com/p/DTJukFfjVZv/ or https://www.tiktok.com/@bradyyourtutor/video/7602038479291206942?is_from_webapp=1
        2. Reels. Ex url: https://www.instagram.com/reels/DUWe9HUEkVT/
    Steps: 
    1. Posts (sometimes video's, sometimes photos. Adjust accordingly)
        - If it is a photo slideshow, it will have "img_index={1,2,3,n}" in the url.
        - Try to get title, ingredients and instructions from the text.
        - These are not mutually exclusive, you may be able to get the title from the text on the post,
        but not the ingredients or instructions. 
        - If any of these 3 (title, ingredients and instructions) are missing, move on to the next extraction
        step
        - The next extraction step is audio. Sometimes there will be a transcript, but othertimes 
        we will have to use a transciber tool or api to take the audio and put it into text. (not needed for photos)
        - Move on to the next extraction step if you still do not have all 3 fields (title, ingredients and instructions)
        - The final method is visual. We will take photos periodically of the video. Then we analyze with computer vision.
        This is currently implemented with some type of computer vision. 
        - If it is a photo slideshow, just download. Do not take screenshots because there is no video. 
        - if we still do not have all three, return a placeholder to the user in the newly created recipe created
    2. Reels
        - Try to get title, ingredients and instructions from the text.
        - These are not mutually exclusive, you may be able to get the title from the text on the post,
        but not the ingredients or instructions. 
        - If any of these 3 (title, ingredients and instructions) are missing, move on to the next extraction
        step
        - The next extraction step is audio. Sometimes there will be a transcript, but othertimes

        - Move on to the next extraction step if you still do not have all 3 fields (title, ingredients and instructions)
        - The final method is visual. We will take photos periodically of the video. Then we analyze with computer vision.
        This is currently implemented with some type of computer vision. 
        - if we still do not have all three, return a placeholder to the user in the newly created recipe created

3. Facebook -> baseurl = facebook.com
     - There are two types of formats that tiktok users can post
        1. Posts. Ex url: https://www.facebook.com/HomeandLifeHack/posts/pfbid0K1emYhduuGzhHYaYwftpG75X1AALRwGucVm4uz3tffLRsH57ESUsnUqjLuR6seFKl

    Steps: 
    1. Posts (sometimes a video, sometimes just a photo)
        - if it is just a photo, the fields we want will almost always be in the caption/title/comments (first 5). 
        if it is not, then sometimes it is in the photo, so just download and analyze with computer vision. 
        - Try to get title, ingredients and instructions from the text.
        - These are not mutually exclusive, you may be able to get the title from the text on the post,
        but not the ingredients or instructions. 
        - If any of these 3 (title, ingredients and instructions) are missing, move on to the next extraction
        step

        - Try to get title, ingredients and instructions from the text.
        - These are not mutually exclusive, you may be able to get the title from the text on the post,
        but not the ingredients or instructions. 
        - If any of these 3 (title, ingredients and instructions) are missing, move on to the next extraction
        step

4. Youtube -> baseurl = youtube.com
    - There are two types of formats that tiktok users can post
        1. Videos. Ex url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYaRp7KSC_E
        2. Shorts. Ex url: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/T4QAV9qbbD4
    Steps: 
    1. videos (always videos)
        - Try to get title, ingredients and instructions from the text.
        - These are not mutually exclusive, you may be able to get the title from the text on the post,
        but not the ingredients or instructions. 
        - If any of these 3 (title, ingredients and instructions) are missing, move on to the next extraction
        step
        - The next extraction step is audio. Sometimes there will be a transcript, but othertimes 
        we will have to use a transciber tool or api to take the audio and put it into text. 
        - Move on to the next extraction step if you still do not have all 3 fields (title, ingredients and instructions)
        - The final method is visual. We will take photos periodically of the video. Then we analyze with computer vision.
        This is currently implemented with some type of computer vision. 
        - These videos can be long, so we want to make sure we have have checks to ensure we take large screenshot intervals. 
        That way the extraction process does not take too long and cost us too much in API costs. 
        - if we still do not have all three, return a placeholder to the user in the newly created recipe created
    2. Shorts (always videos)
        - basically the same and videos except that the metadata might be in a different format so 
        watch out for that. 

5. Pinterest -> baseurl = pinterest.com
    steps: 
    - Pinterest will have a button called "Visit site", if we follow that, it will take us to the 
    recipe site or the cooking blog. From there we can scrape like in #6

6. Other website/people's personal blogs
    - there is no base url, it will be unique.
    - could be behind a paywall, if it is then we handle gracefully and return an error to the user. 

    steps: 
    - extract indredients and instructions from website text. This will be mostly handled by webscapping
